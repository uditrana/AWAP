Similarly to how booths work, lines are also a straight line of tiles. We define a line zone for a booth; the line zone is defined as the tiles that make up the area where a line can be. Thus, a line zone for a company such as Google will consist of tiles, all of which return the value "Google" when `get_line()` is called.

Inside a line zone there exists an actual line. Note that this line is an actual list of bots. Each tile in the line zone can hold a max of 3 bots except for the last tile in the line zone. The last tile can hold infinitely many bots to represent endless lines, but in a finite representation space. Note that with this representation, it is possible to have empty tiles in the line zone; in other words, it is possible for the actual line to not use up every tile in the line zone. If this occurs, the end of the actual line is the first tile in the line zone that has less than 3 bots. If the line goes all the way until the last tile in the line zone, the end of the actual line is located on the last tile.

In order to enter the line, a bot must be in the tile that contains the end of the actual line. For example, if a line zone has 5 tiles and the end of the line is located in the 3rd tile, a bot cannot enter the line from the 5th tile. It must enter the line from the 3rd tile.
