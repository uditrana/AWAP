# Wiki

Welcome to the AWAP 2019 Wiki! This should be your go-to location for any references. For information on any of the classes (Team, Tile, State, or Direction), navigate to their respective pages. For information on how to test your code, go to the Testing page.

If you have any bugs with your code, ping us on Slack if you would like help. If you think there are any bugs with our implementation of the game, please open an issue on the repository with some context about the issue and we will look at it right away.
